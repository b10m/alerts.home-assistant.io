Ziggo has been discouraging the use of the "thuisnetwerk" feature of the Mediabox XL, they even explain [how to undo this](https://www.ziggo.nl/klantenservice/wifi/horizon-uit-het-thuisnetwerk-verwijderen#/).

It seems impossible to get the code running with new(er) mediaboxes and therefore the integration will be removed from Home Assistant in release 0.120.0.
